    <h4>About me</h4>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Liel Robinov, I'm 24 years old and I'm from Herzliya.
      I'm a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business administration
      with a specialization in Information Systems at the Ruppin Academic Center.
      I chose this specialization because I've alwayes been curious about what happend
      "behind the scenes" of computer systems and how things actually work. 
      The specialization is very challenging, but truly worth it!

    <h4>Work</h4>
    <p>
      Alongside my studies, I've been working for a long time at a gas company.
      My job includes customer service, working with unique Information system,
      using Excel at a basic level, and handling daily tasks. This experience has helped
      me a lot - it improved my ability to work under pressure, understand business
      processes, and communicate effectively with people.

   <h4>Hobbies</h4>
   <p>
    In addition to work and studies, I enjoy shopping, dining out, traveling - especially to the beach, listening
    to music, reading books from genres like thriller, romance and current affairs and cooking.
    I believe that everyone should invest in themselves - both in their studies/work and outside of them.

  <h4>The values that guide my life:</h4>
  <p>
  Respect - I believe that respect is one of the most important values in interpersonal relationships. 
  Especially in my family, respect has always been a top priority. A person who does not respect their surroundings will not be able to respect themselves.
<br>
  Honesty and Transparency - I always strive to be open and honest with myself and with those around me, whether it's friends, family, colleagues, or classmates. 
  I believe that honesty builds genuine connections based on trust.
<br>
  Helping Others - I believe that we have the power to help one another, even through small acts. 
  A small gesture of help can be very meaningful to someone else and create a real connection.
<br>
  Responsibility - I believe that taking responsibility for our actions is a fundamental value. 
  Even if I make a mistake, I take responsibility because it builds trust with others and leads to success in any field we engage in.
